Resolved the issue.

The spring boot app requires its ownd jdbc dependency

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>

NON-boot dependency, that I had, is NOT enough alone:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>

Without the "spring-boot-starter-jdbc" dependency "spring.datasource.url" settings in file "application.properties" are not processed. 
That file is actually processed, but not the jdbc settings. Spring boot will create its own testdb in the memory, 
which destroys the data after closing the application.
